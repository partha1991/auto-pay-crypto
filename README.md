# auto-pay-crypto
This Dapp acts as an autopayment channel for payment in Crypto (built on Ethereum platform, so supports only ETH tokens). A user/subscriber can just transfer coins once and then subscriber to services on our portal. As long as there are enough coins left, the subscription keeps auto renewing.

P.S: This is still work in progress. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Truffle or online compilers like EthFiddle/Remix
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Deploy the .sol file on test network using Truffle or however you deploy your smart contracts and you can call the functions to be able to test it.
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Currently, there are no automated tests created for the smart contract(s) yet. These are in the cards.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
